# Password Generator Starter Code
Since this challange provides us the starter code for HTML and CSS, I have only added a <h1> with an ID to HTML in line 29. And which is used to link my JS file. 

# Javascript Code
In Script.JS file, I first set the variables (arrays).
Then I set if statements that use to validate user's input, 
add if statements for four possible options.
Afterward, adding a for statement to start random selection variables,
and adding right after to prevent infinite loop.
Finally, setting the generated password to pop-up in the textbox.
  
Thank you for reviewing, and feel free to leave a comment/ suggestion.
